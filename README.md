# Cabana Man Pool Service

This repository contains the starting point for the **Cabana Man Pool Service** mobile application. The project uses **React Native with Expo** and TypeScript.

At this stage only the folder structure and package dependencies are provided. Individual screens and modules will be added step by step in future commits.

## Folder Structure

- `App.tsx` - Application entry point.
- `app/`
  - `components/` - Reusable UI components (to be implemented).
  - `screens/` - App screens (to be implemented).
  - `database/` - Local storage helpers (to be implemented).
  - `types/` - Shared TypeScript types.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Use the Expo Go app or an emulator to run the project.

Further implementation will follow the order: Home screen → Job List → Job Detail → Route Map → Chemical Calculator → Storage helpers.
